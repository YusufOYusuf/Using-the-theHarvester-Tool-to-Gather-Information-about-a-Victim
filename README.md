<h1>Using the theHarvester Tool to Gather Information about a Victim</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I learned to use the theHarvester tool to gather information about a victim. This tool is intended to help penetration testers in the early stages of the penetration test in order to understand the customer footprint on the Internet. It is also useful for anyone who wants to know what an attacker can see about their organization.
